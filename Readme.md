# Shortest_path_visualizer

Visualizes A\* start path finding algorithm

## Implementation

Allowed a user to pick start, end and barriers and when the user start algorithm, the GUI tool visualizes its shortest path nding work.  
Built a shortest path finding GUI tool to visualize the A\* star path-finding algorithm as it goes.

## Output
